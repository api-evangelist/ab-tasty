      The AB Tasty Decision API is a server-side service that evaluates a
      visitors context against your active experiments, personalizations, and
      feature flags, then returns a deterministic decision: which campaigns the
      user qualifies for, the selected variation, and any variables or content
      to render. It centralizes targeting, traffic allocation, and bucketing so
      you can power A/B tests, gradual rollouts, and personalized experiences
      from backends, mobile apps, or edge workers while keeping user exposure
      consistent. You pass identifiers and attributes at request time, use the
      response to render the experience, and pair it with event tracking for
      measurement.

      AB Tastys Remote Control API is a developer and QA tool that lets you
      programmatically drive the AB Tasty SDK from outside your app or page, so
      you can precisely control and observe experiments without changing
      production targeting. With it, you can preview or force specific campaigns
      and variations for a visitor, toggle or pause experiences, set
      visitor/context attributes, trigger goals and custom events, refresh
      decisions, and clear caches to reproduce clean states. Teams use it to
      debug implementation issues, run automated tests, and create deterministic
      scenarios for demos or CI pipelines, ensuring consistent, repeatable
      experiment behavior across environments.
