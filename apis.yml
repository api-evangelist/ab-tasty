      AB Tasty’s Remote Control API is a developer and QA tool that lets you
      programmatically drive the AB Tasty SDK from outside your app or page, so
      you can precisely control and observe experiments without changing
      production targeting. With it, you can preview or force specific campaigns
      and variations for a visitor, toggle or pause experiences, set
      visitor/context attributes, trigger goals and custom events, refresh
      decisions, and clear caches to reproduce clean states. Teams use it to
      debug implementation issues, run automated tests, and create deterministic
      scenarios for demos or CI pipelines, ensuring consistent, repeatable
      experiment behavior across environments.
